C#-PROJECTS
This repository is a collection of coding exercises and projects that I created using C# and the .NET Framework during the C# portion of The Tech Academy’s curriculum.

Projects:

CarInsurance
This project is an MVC-based web application that simulates a car insurance platform. It collects user input related to policy details and generates a quote using predefined business logic. Additionally, it includes an admin interface where staff members can review all submitted insurance quotes.

Constructor Assignment
Demonstrates constants, the var keyword, and constructor chaining. A constant variable holds a fixed value, while var lets the compiler infer the type. Shows how constructors can call each other for cleaner initialization.

Daily Report Program
A console app that collects daily reports from students. It asks for details like name, course, study hours, and feedback. The data is stored in variables and a confirmation message is displayed at the end.

DateTimeSubnission
A program that shows the current date and time, then asks the user for a number. It calculates and prints the future time after that many hours.

EFCodeFirstConsoleApp
EFCodeFirstConsoleApp is a simple console application built with C# using the Entity Framework Code-First approach. It demonstrates how to define a data model in code, generate a corresponding database, and perform basic data operations. In this project, a student database is created and populated with a sample entry, showcasing foundational concepts of EF Core and database interaction in a console environment.

Input Assignment
A console app that asks the user for a number, saves it into a text file, then reads and displays the file content. Demonstrates file writing and reading in C#.

Lambda Expression Assignment
An Employee class is created and a list of employees is built. A foreach loop and a lambda expression are used to filter employees named “Joe” and employees with an ID greater than 5. Demonstrates working with LINQ/lambda queries.

Parsing Enums Assignment
An enum DaysOfWeek is created. The program asks the user to enter the current day, assigns it to the enum, and handles errors with a try/catch block. Invalid input shows the message: “Please enter an actual day of the week.”

Struct Assignment
A struct Number with a decimal property Amount. In Main, a Number object is created, an amount is assigned, and the value is printed to the console.

Try Catch Assignment
A console app that asks for the user’s age and calculates the birth year. Uses try/catch blocks to handle invalid input, including zero, negative, or other errors, and prints custom error messages.

TwentyOne
TwentyOne Console Game is a C# console application that simulates the classic Blackjack casino game. It offers engaging gameplay with interactive responses, recreating the feel of a real casino environment. Players face off against the dealer, make strategic choices, and enjoy dynamic feedback that enhances the overall experience. This project was developed in collaboration with a Tech Academy instructor, and it provided me with valuable learning opportunities throughout the process.
